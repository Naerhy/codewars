A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building
blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up
with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to
know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have
to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task:

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the
square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with
itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in
dynamic typed languages.

Examples:
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
